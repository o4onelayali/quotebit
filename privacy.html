            </h2>
            <p>
                Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our Services, to administer your
                use of the Services (including your Account, if you are an Account holder), and to enable you to enjoy
                and easily navigate our Services.
                <br>The data we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us, the choices you make,
                including
                your privacy settings, and the products and features you use. The data we collect can include SDK/API/JS
                code version, browser, Internet service provider, IP address, platform, timestamp, application
                identifier, application version, application distribution channel, independent device identifier, iOS ad

            </h2>
            <p>
                If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information that can be used to identify you, such as
                your email address ("PII"). If you create an Account using your login credentials from one of your
                Social Networking Sites (the "SNS") Accounts, we’ll be able to access and collect your name and other
                PII that your privacy settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. If you create an Account through
                the Services or one of your SNS Accounts, we may also collect your gender, date of birth and other
                information that is not considered PII because it cannot be used by itself to identify you.

                2.2 Information Collected Using Cookies and other Web Technologies
            </h2>
            <p>
                Like many website owners and operators, we use automated data collection tools such as Cookies and Web
                Beacons to collect certain information. "Cookies" are small text files that are placed on your device by
                a web server when you access our Services. We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies to
                identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you interact with our
                Services. We may also use cookies to monitor aggregate usage and web traffic routing on our Services and
                to customize and improve our Services. Unlike persistent cookies, session cookies are deleted when you
                log off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers automatically accept cookies,
                you can change your browser options to stop automatically accepting cookies or to prompt you before
                accepting cookies. Please note, however, that if you don’t accept cookies, you may not be able to access
                all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services providers that we engage (including
                third-party advertisers) may also place their own cookies on your device. Note that this Privacy Policy
                covers only our use of cookies and does not include use of cookies by such third parties. "Web Beacons"
                (also known as Web bugs, pixel tags or clear GIFs) are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that may
                be included on our Services for several purposes, including to deliver or communicate with Cookies, to
                track and measure the performance of our Services, to monitor how many visitors view our Services, and
                to monitor the effectiveness of our advertising. Unlike Cookies, which are stored on the user’s hard
                drive, Web Beacons are typically embedded invisibly on web pages (or in an e-mail).
            </p>

            <h2>
                2.3 Information Related to Use of the Services
            </h2>
            <p>
                Our servers automatically record certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to
                this information as "Log Data"), including both Account holders and non-Account holders (either, a
                "User"). Log Data may include information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type,
                operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our Services, the pages or
                features of our Services to which a User browsed and the time spent on those pages or features, search
                terms, the links on our Services that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use Log Data to
                administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze) Log Data to improve,
                customize and enhance the Services by expanding their features and functionality and tailoring them to
                our Users’ needs and preferences. We may use a person’s IP address to fight spam, malware and identity
                theft. We also use the IP Address to generate aggregate, non-identifying information about how our
                Services are used.

            </h2>
            <p>
                We collect certain information that your mobile device sends when you use our Services, like a device
                identifier, user settings and the operating system of your device, as well as information about your use
                of our Services.

                In some cases we may collect and store information about where you are located, such as by converting
                your IP address into a rough geolocation or by accessing your mobile device’s GPS coordinates or coarse
                location if you enable location services on your device. We may use location information to improve and
                personalize our Services for you. If you do not want us to collect location information, you may disable
                that feature on your mobile device.

                We may sell subscriptions or merchandise through our Services. When you make purchases through the
                Services, we process your payments through a third party application, including the Apple App Store,
                Google Play App Store, Amazon App Store (together with any similar applications, "App Stores"), SNS such
                as Facebook, and other third-party payment processers. The third party application may collect certain
                financial information from you to process a payment on behalf of us, including your name, email address,
                address and other billing information.

                We may engage third-party services providers to work with us to administer and provide the Services.
                These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for the purpose of performing services
                on our behalf. We may also share your PII except with our marketing service providers to help us better
                market our products and services to you. Our marketing service providers may use your PII only for the
                purpose of helping us better market our products and services to you and are prohibited from
                transferring your PII to others.

                3.2 Information Shared with Other Systems, Such As HealthKit or Google Fit
            </h2>
            <p>
                You may instruct us to share certain of your information with systems such as Apple’s HealthKit or
                Google Fit, and to access information from those systems which we will use to improve the services we
                provide to you. Before you tell us to share your information with another system, however, you should
                review the applicable privacy policy of that system, since any information you have instructed us to
                share will become subject to those policies.<br>
                In addition, in the event that you use one of those services, you should be careful about allowing other
                applications, services or people to access your information through that service. While much information
                collected by those services is innocuous, people who see Om Zone data may be able to determine a variety
                of personal information.<br>
                Om Zone does not use or disclose to third parties user data or other information gained through the use
                of the HealthKit framework or Google Fit for advertising, other use-based data mining purposes or
                similar services, other than for purposes of improving health or for purposes of health or medical
                research.<br>
                We do not write your data to the HealthKit store without your permission.<br>
                We do not sell any of your information, including information gained through HealthKit or Google Fit, to
                advertising platforms, data brokers or information resellers.<br>
                We do not use any of the information obtained through HealthKit or Google Fit for any purpose other than
                providing health and/or fitness services in connection with the Services.

                To improve our product and provide you better service, we also share personal data with vendors or
                agents working on our behalf for the purposes described in this privacy policy. For example, companies
                we’ve hired to provide data analytical services may need collect and access to personal data to provide
                those functions. Any third party with whom we share user data will provide equal protection of user data
                as stated in this privacy policy.

            <p>
                Our Services may contain links to other websites and services. Any information that you provide on or to
                a third-party website or service is provided directly to the owner of the website or service and is
                subject to that party’s privacy policy. Our Privacy Policy does not apply to such websites or services
                and we’re not responsible for the content, privacy or security practices and policies of those websites
                or services. To protect your information we recommend that you carefully review the privacy policies of
                other websites and services that you access.<br>
                We may offer advertisements displayed in Om Zone, and may engage third-party services providers to work
                with us. All ads displayed in Om Zone are appropriate for age 4 and up, allow the user to see all
                information used to target them for that ad (without requiring the user to leave the app), and do not
                engage in targeted or behavioral advertising based on sensitive user data such as health/medical data
                (e.g. from the HealthKit APIs).<br>
                Interstitial ads or ads that interrupt or block the user experience will clearly indicate that they are
                an ad, will not manipulate or trick users into tapping into them, and will provide easily accessible and
                visible close/skip buttons large enough for users to easily dismiss the ad.<br>

                If you are aware of changes or inaccuracies in your information, you should inform us of such changes so
                that our records may be updated or corrected. You may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if
                you consider that our processing of your Personal Data infringes applicable law.<br>
                We retain your Personal Data as long as needed to provide services or products to you, or as required or
                permitted by applicable laws, such as tax and accounting laws.
